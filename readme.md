This app allows the user to make a purchase from inventory stored in a MySql Database. 

The user is presented with an inital menu displaying all products, their quantities, and prices

Then the user chooses one product and enters a quantity they would like to purchase
![Alt text](/read_me_img/purchase_confirm.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

If there are not enough of that product, the user will get a message showing how many are left and asking for a different quantity

After the purchase, the user is shown their total, and asked if they would like to purchase anything else.

If they would like to make another purchase, they are sent back to the inital menu, otherwise they exit the program.
